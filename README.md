# 🚀 Researcher => | Cognitive Science | Theoretical Computer Science | Philosophy

I am an undergraduate student developing an integrated research framework connecting cognitive science, theoretical computer science, and philosophy through formal modeling, computational methods, and conceptual analysis.

## 🧠 Research Interests
- **Formalization of Cognition**: Building and critically evaluating mathematical and computational models of inference, learning, perception, and decision-making.
- **Computational Philosophy**: Applying algorithmic and formal techniques to reframe classical problems in metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of mind.
- **Philosophy of Computation**: Investigating foundational ideas—algorithm, complexity, proof, information—and their broader philosophical implications.

## 🔬 Current Focus
- Formal cognitive modeling (symbolic and hybrid architectures)
- Logical systems (modal logic, type theory, non-classical logics)
- Computational foundations of philosophical problems
- Mastering technical tools: Python, Coq, Java, Scheme/Racket, C/C++, Rust, Lean, Haskell, Lisp, OCaml, Alloy

---

## 🌱 Academic Trajectory
- Actively building interdisciplinary expertise at the intersection of philosophy, computer science, and cognitive science.
- Preparing for graduate research focused on formal methods, cognitive modeling, and computational foundations of philosophy.
- Committed to developing integrative, rigorous scholarship that bridges conceptual inquiry with technical precision.

## 🌐 Long-Term Vision
To contribute to a deeper understanding of cognition, computation, and reasoning through a blend of formal rigor, philosophical insight, and interdisciplinary integration.
